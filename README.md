# BaseComp: A Comparative Analysis for Integrity Protection in Cellular Baseband Software

## How to use

1. Load the baseband firmware to ida with the `idb-creation` directory.
2. Find the integrity protection function in the firmware with the `function-identification` directory.
3. Symbolic execution and automated comparative analysis can be done with the `symbolic-execution` directory.
